    <h2>Where in Singapore can I locate affordable HDB flats?</h1>

        <p>
        <p>The line charts below compares the median price of all HDB apartment types with different neighbourhoods in
            Singapore. The data is based on the resale transactions of flats between 2017-2023.<br><br> Each line chart
            represent each year and is used as it clearly shows
            comparisons between different neighbourhoods, allowing the reader to distinguish higher or lower average
            resale prices between different neighbourhoods from a glance. <br><br></p>

        </div>



        <p>The line charts show that the cheapest flats are generally located in areas
            such as Ang Mo Kio, Woodlands, Jurong West, and Sembawang. Some of the cheapest flats are also found in the
            eastern part of Singapore, such as in Bedok and Pasir Ris. On the other hand, the most expensive flats are
            located in prime
            areas such as Bukit Merah, Bukit Timah, Central Area, and Queenstown.</p>
